libpam-usb (0.5.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  Information about devices' vendor and serial have been stripped off
  from the "device" field of the configuration files supported by the
  0.5.0 release. Please keep that in mind while upgrading from 0.4.2
  to 0.5.0 since old configuration files stored in /etc/pamusb.conf
  may likely need to be either fixed by hand or regenerated by the
  support tool /usr/bin/pamusb-conf provided by pamusb-common.
