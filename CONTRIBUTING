# Contributing

## Basics

You want to contribute? Awesome! Thanks for that!

Every contribution is required to be GPLv2 (or compatible) licensed (see COPYING). If you don't specify any license GPLv2 will be assumed.

## How to contribute code changes

Please fork the repository, implement your changes in a branch and then submit a pull request. 

In that pull request you should...
- explain what exactly your change does
- why it does that
- assign yourself
- assign matching tags

Ideally you would create an issue before, assigning it to yourself and reference it in your pull request but that is not a hard requirement.

## How to contribute documentation

The Wiki should be editable by anyone, feel free to just work on it. In case you want to work on the manpages: these are managed in code - see "How to contribute code changes"

## How to suggest new features

Please create an issue.
